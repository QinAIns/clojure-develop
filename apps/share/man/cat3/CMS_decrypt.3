       _C_M_S___d_e_c_r_y_p_t_(_) extracts and decrypts the content from a CMS Enveloped-
       Data structure. ppkkeeyy is the private key of the recipient, cceerrtt is the
       recipient's certificate, oouutt is a BIO to write the content to and ffllaaggss
       is an optional set of flags.

       The ddccoonntt parameter is used in the rare case where the encrypted con-
       tent is detached. It will normally be set to NULL.

       _O_p_e_n_S_S_L___a_d_d___a_l_l___a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m_s_(_) (or equivalent) should be called before
       using this function or errors about unknown algorithms will occur.

       Although the recipients certificate is not needed to decrypt the data
       it is needed to locate the appropriate (of possible several) recipients
       in the CMS structure. If cceerrtt is set to NULL all possible recipients
       are tried.

       It is possible to determine the correct recipient key by other means
       (for example looking them up in a database) and setting them in the CMS
       structure in advance using the CMS utility functions such as
       _C_M_S___s_e_t_1___p_k_e_y_(_). In this case both cceerrtt and ppkkeeyy should be set to NULL.

       To process KEKRecipientInfo types _C_M_S___s_e_t_1___k_e_y_(_) or _C_M_S___R_e_c_i_p_i_-
       _e_n_t_I_n_f_o___s_e_t_0___k_e_y_(_) and _C_M_S___R_e_c_e_i_p_i_e_n_t_I_n_f_o___d_e_c_r_y_p_t_(_) should be called
       before _C_M_S___d_e_c_r_y_p_t_(_) and cceerrtt and ppkkeeyy set to NULL.

       The following flags can be passed in the ffllaaggss parameter.

       If the CCMMSS__TTEEXXTT flag is set MIME headers for type tteexxtt//ppllaaiinn are
       deleted from the content. If the content is not of type tteexxtt//ppllaaiinn then
       an error is returned.

       _C_M_S___d_e_c_r_y_p_t_(_) returns either 1 for success or 0 for failure.  The error
       can be obtained from _E_R_R___g_e_t___e_r_r_o_r(3)

BBUUGGSS
       The lack of single pass processing and the need to hold all data in
       memory as mentioned in _C_M_S___v_e_r_i_f_y_(_) also applies to _C_M_S___d_e_c_r_y_p_t_(_).
