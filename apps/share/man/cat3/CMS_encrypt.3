       _C_M_S___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) creates and returns a CMS EnvelopedData structure. cceerrttss
       is a list of recipient certificates. iinn is the content to be encrypted.
       cciipphheerr is the symmetric cipher to use. ffllaaggss is an optional set of
       flags.

NNOOTTEESS
       Only certificates carrying RSA keys are supported so the recipient cer-
       tificates supplied to this function must all contain RSA public keys,
       though they do not have to be signed using the RSA algorithm.

       _E_V_P___d_e_s___e_d_e_3___c_b_c_(_) (triple DES) is the algorithm of choice for S/MIME
       use because most clients will support it.

       The algorithm passed in the cciipphheerr parameter must support ASN1 encoding
       of its parameters.

       Many browsers implement a "sign and encrypt" option which is simply an
       S/MIME envelopedData containing an S/MIME signed message. This can be
       readily produced by storing the S/MIME signed message in a memory BIO
       and passing it to _C_M_S___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_).

       The following flags can be passed in the ffllaaggss parameter.

       If the CCMMSS__TTEEXXTT flag is set MIME headers for type tteexxtt//ppllaaiinn are
       prepended to the data.

       Normally the supplied content is translated into MIME canonical format
       (as required by the S/MIME specifications) if CCMMSS__BBIINNAARRYY is set no
       translation occurs. This option should be used if the supplied data is
       in binary format otherwise the translation will corrupt it. If
       CCMMSS__BBIINNAARRYY is set then CCMMSS__TTEEXXTT is ignored.

       OpenSSL will by default identify recipient certificates using issuer
       name and serial number. If CCMMSS__UUSSEE__KKEEYYIIDD is set it will use the subject
       key identifier value instead. An error occurs if all recipient certifi-
       cates do not have a subject key identifier extension.

       If the CCMMSS__SSTTRREEAAMM flag is set a partial CCMMSS__CCoonntteennttIInnffoo structure is
       returned suitable for streaming I/O: no data is read from the BIO iinn.

       If the CCMMSS__PPAARRTTIIAALL flag is set a partial CCMMSS__CCoonntteennttIInnffoo structure is
       returned to which additional recipients and attributes can be added
       before finalization.

       The data being encrypted is included in the CMS_ContentInfo structure,
       unless CCMMSS__DDEETTAACCHHEEDD is set in which case it is omitted. This is rarely
       used in practice and is not supported by _S_M_I_M_E___w_r_i_t_e___C_M_S_(_).

NNOOTTEESS
       If the flag CCMMSS__SSTTRREEAAMM is set the returned CCMMSS__CCoonntteennttIInnffoo structure is
       nnoott complete and outputting its contents via a function that does not
       properly finalize the CCMMSS__CCoonntteennttIInnffoo structure will give unpredictable
       results.

       Several functions including _S_M_I_M_E___w_r_i_t_e___C_M_S_(_), _i_2_d___C_M_S___b_i_o___s_t_r_e_a_m_(_),
       _P_E_M___w_r_i_t_e___b_i_o___C_M_S___s_t_r_e_a_m_(_) finalize the structure. Alternatively final-
       ization can be performed by obtaining the streaming ASN1 BBIIOO directly
       using _B_I_O___n_e_w___C_M_S_(_).

       The recipients specified in cceerrttss use a CMS KeyTransRecipientInfo info
       structure. KEKRecipientInfo is also supported using the flag CCMMSS__PPAARR--
       TTIIAALL and _C_M_S___a_d_d_0___r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t___k_e_y_(_).

       The parameter cceerrttss may be NULL if CCMMSS__PPAARRTTIIAALL is set and recipients
       added later using _C_M_S___a_d_d_1___r_e_c_i_p_i_e_n_t___c_e_r_t_(_) or _C_M_S___a_d_d_0___r_e_c_i_p_i_-
       _e_n_t___k_e_y_(_).

       _C_M_S___e_n_c_r_y_p_t_(_) returns either a CMS_ContentInfo structure or NULL if an
       error occurred. The error can be obtained from _E_R_R___g_e_t___e_r_r_o_r(3).
