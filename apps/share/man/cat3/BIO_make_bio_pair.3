       _B_I_O___s___b_i_o_(_) returns the method for a BIO pair. A BIO pair is a pair of
       source/sink BIOs where data written to either half of the pair is
       buffered and can be read from the other half. Both halves must usually
       by handled by the same application thread since no locking is done on
       the internal data structures.

       Since BIO chains typically end in a source/sink BIO it is possible to
       make this one half of a BIO pair and have all the data processed by the
       chain under application control.

       One typical use of BIO pairs is to place TLS/SSL I/O under application
       control, this can be used when the application wishes to use a non
       standard transport for TLS/SSL or the normal socket routines are inap-
       propriate.

       Calls to _B_I_O___r_e_a_d_(_) will read data from the buffer or request a retry
       if no data is available.

       Calls to _B_I_O___w_r_i_t_e_(_) will place data in the buffer or request a retry
       if the buffer is full.

       The standard calls _B_I_O___c_t_r_l___p_e_n_d_i_n_g_(_) and _B_I_O___c_t_r_l___w_p_e_n_d_i_n_g_(_) can be
       used to determine the amount of pending data in the read or write buf-
       fer.

       _B_I_O___r_e_s_e_t_(_) clears any data in the write buffer.

       _B_I_O___m_a_k_e___b_i_o___p_a_i_r_(_) joins two separate BIOs into a connected pair.

       _B_I_O___d_e_s_t_r_o_y___p_a_i_r_(_) destroys the association between two connected BIOs.
       Freeing up any half of the pair will automatically destroy the associa-
       tion.

       _B_I_O___s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n___w_r_(_) is used to close down a BIO bb. After this call no
       further writes on BIO bb are allowed (they will return an error). Reads
       on the other half of the pair will return any pending data or EOF when
       all pending data has been read.

       _B_I_O___s_e_t___w_r_i_t_e___b_u_f___s_i_z_e_(_) sets the write buffer size of BIO bb to ssiizzee.
       If the size is not initialized a default value is used. This is cur-
       rently 17K, sufficient for a maximum size TLS record.

       _B_I_O___g_e_t___w_r_i_t_e___b_u_f___s_i_z_e_(_) returns the size of the write buffer.

       _B_I_O___n_e_w___b_i_o___p_a_i_r_(_) combines the calls to _B_I_O___n_e_w_(_), _B_I_O___m_a_k_e___b_i_o___p_a_i_r_(_)
       and _B_I_O___s_e_t___w_r_i_t_e___b_u_f___s_i_z_e_(_) to create a connected pair of BIOs bbiioo11,
       bbiioo22 with write buffer sizes wwrriitteebbuuff11 and wwrriitteebbuuff22. If either size is
       zero then the default size is used.  _B_I_O___n_e_w___b_i_o___p_a_i_r_(_) does not check
       whether bbiioo11 or bbiioo22 do point to some other BIO, the values are over-
       written, _B_I_O___f_r_e_e_(_) is not called.

       _B_I_O___g_e_t___w_r_i_t_e___g_u_a_r_a_n_t_e_e_(_) and _B_I_O___c_t_r_l___g_e_t___w_r_i_t_e___g_u_a_r_a_n_t_e_e_(_) return the
       maximum length of data that can be currently written to the BIO. Writes
       larger than this value will return a value from _B_I_O___w_r_i_t_e_(_) less than
       the amount requested or if the buffer is full request a retry.
       _B_I_O___c_t_r_l___g_e_t___w_r_i_t_e___g_u_a_r_a_n_t_e_e_(_) is a function whereas
       _B_I_O___g_e_t___w_r_i_t_e___g_u_a_r_a_n_t_e_e_(_) is a macro.

       _B_I_O___g_e_t___r_e_a_d___r_e_q_u_e_s_t_(_) and _B_I_O___c_t_r_l___g_e_t___r_e_a_d___r_e_q_u_e_s_t_(_) return the
       amount of data requested, or the buffer size if it is less, if the last
       read attempt at the other half of the BIO pair failed due to an empty
       buffer.  This can be used to determine how much data should be written
       to the BIO so the next read will succeed: this is most useful in
       TLS/SSL applications where the amount of data read is usually meaning-
       ful rather than just a buffer size. After a successful read this call
       will return zero.  It also will return zero once new data has been
       written satisfying the read request or part of it.  Note that
       _B_I_O___g_e_t___r_e_a_d___r_e_q_u_e_s_t_(_) never returns an amount larger than that
       returned by _B_I_O___g_e_t___w_r_i_t_e___g_u_a_r_a_n_t_e_e_(_).

       _B_I_O___c_t_r_l___r_e_s_e_t___r_e_a_d___r_e_q_u_e_s_t_(_) can also be used to reset the value
       returned by _B_I_O___g_e_t___r_e_a_d___r_e_q_u_e_s_t_(_) to zero.

NNOOTTEESS
       Both halves of a BIO pair should be freed. That is even if one half is
       implicit freed due to a _B_I_O___f_r_e_e___a_l_l_(_) or _S_S_L___f_r_e_e_(_) call the other
       half needs to be freed.

       When used in bidirectional applications (such as TLS/SSL) care should
       be taken to flush any data in the write buffer. This can be done by
       calling _B_I_O___p_e_n_d_i_n_g_(_) on the other half of the pair and, if any data is
       pending, reading it and sending it to the underlying transport. This
       must be done before any normal processing (such as calling _s_e_l_e_c_t_(_) )
       due to a request and _B_I_O___s_h_o_u_l_d___r_e_a_d_(_) being true.

       To see why this is important consider a case where a request is sent
       using _B_I_O___w_r_i_t_e_(_) and a response read with _B_I_O___r_e_a_d_(_), this can occur
       during an TLS/SSL handshake for example. _B_I_O___w_r_i_t_e_(_) will succeed and
       place data in the write buffer. _B_I_O___r_e_a_d_(_) will initially fail and
       _B_I_O___s_h_o_u_l_d___r_e_a_d_(_) will be true. If the application then waits for data
       to be available on the underlying transport before flushing the write
       buffer it will never succeed because the request was never sent!

       _B_I_O___n_e_w___b_i_o___p_a_i_r_(_) returns 1 on success, with the new BIOs available in
       bbiioo11 and bbiioo22, or 0 on failure, with NULL pointers stored into the
       locations for bbiioo11 and bbiioo22. Check the error stack for more informa-
       tion.

       The BIO pair can be used to have full control over the network access
       of an application. The application can call _s_e_l_e_c_t_(_) on the socket as
       required without having to go through the SSL-interface.

        BIO *internal_bio, *network_bio;
        ...
        BIO_new_bio_pair(internal_bio, 0, network_bio, 0);
        SSL_set_bio(ssl, internal_bio, internal_bio);
        SSL_operations();
        ...

        application |   TLS-engine
           |        |
           +----------> SSL_operations()
                    |     /\    ||
                    |     ||    \/
                    |   BIO-pair (internal_bio)
           +----------< BIO-pair (network_bio)
           |        |
         socket     |

         ...
         SSL_free(ssl);                /* implicitly frees internal_bio */
         BIO_free(network_bio);
         ...

       As the BIO pair will only buffer the data and never directly access the
       connection, it behaves non-blocking and will return as soon as the
       write buffer is full or the read buffer is drained. Then the applica-
       tion has to flush the write buffer and/or fill the read buffer.

       Use the _B_I_O___c_t_r_l___p_e_n_d_i_n_g_(_), to find out whether data is buffered in the
       BIO and must be transfered to the network. Use
       _B_I_O___c_t_r_l___g_e_t___r_e_a_d___r_e_q_u_e_s_t_(_) to find out, how many bytes must be written
       into the buffer before the _S_S_L___o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_(_) can successfully be contin-
       ued.

WWAARRNNIINNGG
       As the data is buffered, _S_S_L___o_p_e_r_a_t_i_o_n_(_) may return with a
       ERROR_SSL_WANT_READ condition, but there is still data in the write
       buffer. An application must not rely on the error value of _S_S_L___o_p_e_r_a_-
       _t_i_o_n_(_) but must assure that the write buffer is always flushed first.
       Otherwise a deadlock may occur as the peer might be waiting for the
       data before being able to continue.
