       The shutdown state of an ssl connection is a bitmask of:

       0   No shutdown setting, yet.

       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN
           A "close notify" shutdown alert was sent to the peer, the connec-
           tion is being considered closed and the session is closed and cor-
           rect.

       SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN
           A shutdown alert was received form the peer, either a normal "close
           notify" or a fatal error.

       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN and SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN can be set at the same
       time.

       The shutdown state of the connection is used to determine the state of
       the ssl session. If the session is still open, when _S_S_L___c_l_e_a_r(3) or
       _S_S_L___f_r_e_e(3) is called, it is considered bad and removed according to
       RFC2246.  The actual condition for a correctly closed session is
       SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN (according to the TLS RFC, it is acceptable to only
       send the "close notify" alert but to not wait for the peer's answer,
       when the underlying connection is closed).  _S_S_L___s_e_t___s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n_(_) can be
       used to set this state without sending a close alert to the peer (see
       _S_S_L___s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n(3)).

       If a "close notify" was received, SSL_RECEIVED_SHUTDOWN will be set,
       for setting SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN the application must however still call
       _S_S_L___s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n(3) or _S_S_L___s_e_t___s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n_(_) itself.

       _S_S_L___s_e_t___s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n_(_) does not return diagnostic information.

       _S_S_L___g_e_t___s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n_(_) returns the current setting.
