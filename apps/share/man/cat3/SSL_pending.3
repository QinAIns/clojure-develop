       _S_S_L___p_e_n_d_i_n_g_(_) returns the number of bytes which are available inside
       ssssll for immediate read.

NNOOTTEESS
       Data are received in blocks from the peer. Therefore data can be
       buffered inside ssssll and are ready for immediate retrieval with
       _S_S_L___r_e_a_d(3).

       The number of bytes pending is returned.

BBUUGGSS
       _S_S_L___p_e_n_d_i_n_g_(_) takes into account only bytes from the TLS/SSL record
       that is currently being processed (if any).  If the SSSSLL object's
       _r_e_a_d___a_h_e_a_d flag is set, additional protocol bytes may have been read
       containing more TLS/SSL records; these are ignored by _S_S_L___p_e_n_d_i_n_g_(_).

       Up to OpenSSL 0.9.6, _S_S_L___p_e_n_d_i_n_g_(_) does not check if the record type of
       pending data is application data.
