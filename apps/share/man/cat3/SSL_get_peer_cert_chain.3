       cates forming the certificate chain of the peer. If called on the
       client side, the stack also contains the peer's certificate; if called
       on the server side, the peer's certificate must be obtained separately
       using _S_S_L___g_e_t___p_e_e_r___c_e_r_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_e(3).  If the peer did not present a cer-
       tificate, NULL is returned.

       The peer certificate chain is not necessarily available after reusing a
       session, in which case a NULL pointer is returned.

       The reference count of the STACKOF(X509) object is not incremented.  If
       the corresponding session is freed, the pointer must not be used any
       longer.

       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
           No certificate was presented by the peer or no connection was
           established or the certificate chain is no longer available when a
           session is reused.

       Pointer to a STACKOF(X509)
           The return value points to the certificate chain presented by the
           peer.
