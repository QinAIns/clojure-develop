       OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER is a numeric release version identifier:

        MMNNFFPPS: major minor fix patch status

       The status nibble has one of the values 0 for development, 1 to e for
       betas 1 to 14, and f for release.

       for example

        0x000906000 == 0.9.6 dev
        0x000906023 == 0.9.6b beta 3
        0x00090605f == 0.9.6e release

       Versions prior to 0.9.3 have identifiers < 0x0930.  Versions between
       0.9.3 and 0.9.5 had a version identifier with this interpretation:

        MMNNFFRBB major minor fix final beta/patch

       for example

        0x000904100 == 0.9.4 release
        0x000905000 == 0.9.5 dev

       Version 0.9.5a had an interim interpretation that is like the current
       one, except the patch level got the highest bit set, to keep continu-
       ity.  The number was therefore 0x0090581f.

       For backward compatibility, SSLEAY_VERSION_NUMBER is also defined.

       _S_S_L_e_a_y_(_) returns this number. The return value can be compared to the
       macro to make sure that the correct version of the library has been
       loaded, especially when using DLLs on Windows systems.

       _S_S_L_e_a_y___v_e_r_s_i_o_n_(_) returns different strings depending on tt:

       SSLEAY_VERSION
           The text variant of the version number and the release date.  For
           example, "OpenSSL 0.9.5a 1 Apr 2000".

       SSLEAY_CFLAGS
           The compiler flags set for the compilation process in the form
           "compiler: ..."  if available or "compiler: information not avail-
           able" otherwise.

       SSLEAY_BUILT_ON
           The date of the build process in the form "built on: ..." if avail-
           able or "built on: date not available" otherwise.

       SSLEAY_PLATFORM
           The "Configure" target of the library build in the form "platform:
           ..."  if available or "platform: information not available" other-
           wise.

       SSLEAY_DIR
           The "OPENSSLDIR" setting of the library build in the form
           "OPENSSLDIR: "...""  if available or "OPENSSLDIR: N/A" otherwise.

       For an unknown tt, the text "not available" is returned.

       _S_S_L_e_a_y_(_) and SSLEAY_VERSION_NUMBER are available in all versions of
       SSLeay and OpenSSL.  OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER is available in all ver-
       sions of OpenSSL.  SSSSLLEEAAYY__DDIIRR was added in OpenSSL 0.9.7.
