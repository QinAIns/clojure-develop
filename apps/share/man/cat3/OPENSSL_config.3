       _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___c_o_n_f_i_g_(_) configures OpenSSL using the standard ooppeennssssll..ccnnff con-
       figuration file name using ccoonnffiigg__nnaammee. If ccoonnffiigg__nnaammee is NULL then the
       default name ooppeennssssll__ccoonnff will be used. Any errors are ignored. Further
       calls to _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___c_o_n_f_i_g_(_) will have no effect. The configuration file
       format is documented in the _c_o_n_f(5) manual page.

       _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___n_o___c_o_n_f_i_g_(_) disables configuration. If called before
       _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___c_o_n_f_i_g_(_) no configuration takes place.

       It is ssttrroonnggllyy recommended that aallll new applications call _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___c_o_n_-
       _f_i_g_(_) or the more sophisticated functions such as _C_O_N_F___m_o_d_u_l_e_s___l_o_a_d_(_)
       during initialization (that is before starting any threads). By doing
       this an application does not need to keep track of all configuration
       options and some new functionality can be supported automatically.

       It is also possible to automatically call _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___c_o_n_f_i_g_(_) when an
       application calls _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___a_d_d___a_l_l___a_l_g_o_r_i_t_h_m_s_(_) by compiling an applica-
       tion with the preprocessor symbol OOPPEENNSSSSLL__LLOOAADD__CCOONNFF #define'd. In this
       way configuration can be added without source changes.

       The environment variable OOPPEENNSSSSLL__CCOONNFF can be set to specify the loca-
       tion of the configuration file.

       Currently ASN1 OBJECTs and ENGINE configuration can be performed future
       versions of OpenSSL will add new configuration options.

       There are several reasons why calling the OpenSSL configuration rou-
       tines is advisable. For example new ENGINE functionality was added to
       OpenSSL 0.9.7.  In OpenSSL 0.9.7 control functions can be supported by
       ENGINEs, this can be used (among other things) to load dynamic ENGINEs
       from shared libraries (DSOs).  However very few applications currently
       support the control interface and so very few can load and use dynamic
       ENGINEs. Equally in future more sophisticated ENGINEs will require cer-
       tain control operations to customize them. If an application calls
       _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___c_o_n_f_i_g_(_) it doesn't need to know or care about ENGINE control
       operations because they can be performed by editing a configuration
       file.

       Applications should free up configuration at application closedown by
       calling _C_O_N_F___m_o_d_u_l_e_s___f_r_e_e_(_).

       The _O_P_E_N_S_S_L___c_o_n_f_i_g_(_) function is designed to be a very simple "call it
       and forget it" function. As a result its behaviour is somewhat limited.
       It ignores all errors silently and it can only load from the standard
       configuration file location for example.

       It is however mmuucchh better than nothing. Applications which need finer
       control over their configuration functionality should use the configu-
       ration functions such as _C_O_N_F___l_o_a_d___m_o_d_u_l_e_s_(_) directly.
