        int CMS_uncompress(CMS_ContentInfo *cms, BIO *dcont, BIO *out, unsigned int flags);

       _C_M_S___u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_(_) extracts and uncompresses the content from a CMS Com-
       pressedData structure ccmmss. ddaattaa is a BIO to write the content to and
       ffllaaggss is an optional set of flags.

       The ddccoonntt parameter is used in the rare case where the compressed con-
       tent is detached. It will normally be set to NULL.

NNOOTTEESS
       The only currently supported compression algorithm is zlib: if the
       structure indicates the use of any other algorithm an error is
       returned.

       If zlib support is not compiled into OpenSSL then _C_M_S___u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_(_) will
       always return an error.

       The following flags can be passed in the ffllaaggss parameter.

       If the CCMMSS__TTEEXXTT flag is set MIME headers for type tteexxtt//ppllaaiinn are
       deleted from the content. If the content is not of type tteexxtt//ppllaaiinn then
       an error is returned.

       _C_M_S___u_n_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_(_) returns either 1 for success or 0 for failure. The
       error can be obtained from _E_R_R___g_e_t___e_r_r_o_r(3)

BBUUGGSS
       The lack of single pass processing and the need to hold all data in
       memory as mentioned in _C_M_S___v_e_r_i_f_y_(_) also applies to _C_M_S___d_e_c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_(_).
