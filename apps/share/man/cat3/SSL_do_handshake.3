       _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_) will wait for a SSL/TLS handshake to take place. If
       the connection is in client mode, the handshake will be started. The
       handshake routines may have to be explicitly set in advance using
       either _S_S_L___s_e_t___c_o_n_n_e_c_t___s_t_a_t_e(3) or _S_S_L___s_e_t___a_c_c_e_p_t___s_t_a_t_e(3).

       The behaviour of _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_) depends on the underlying BIO.

       If the underlying BIO is bblloocckkiinngg, _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_) will only return
       once the handshake has been finished or an error occurred, except for
       SGC (Server Gated Cryptography). For SGC, _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_) may return
       with -1, but _S_S_L___g_e_t___e_r_r_o_r_(_) will yield SSSSLL__EERRRROORR__WWAANNTT__RREEAADD//WWRRIITTEE and
       _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_) should be called again.

       If the underlying BIO is nnoonn--bblloocckkiinngg, _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_) will also
       return when the underlying BIO could not satisfy the needs of
       _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_) to continue the handshake. In this case a call to
       _S_S_L___g_e_t___e_r_r_o_r_(_) with the return value of _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_) will yield
       SSSSLL__EERRRROORR__WWAANNTT__RREEAADD or SSSSLL__EERRRROORR__WWAANNTT__WWRRIITTEE. The calling process then
       must repeat the call after taking appropriate action to satisfy the
       needs of _S_S_L___d_o___h_a_n_d_s_h_a_k_e_(_).  The action depends on the underlying BIO.
       When using a non-blocking socket, nothing is to be done, but _s_e_l_e_c_t_(_)
       can be used to check for the required condition. When using a buffering
       BIO, like a BIO pair, data must be written into or retrieved out of the
       BIO before being able to continue.

       The following return values can occur:

       1   The TLS/SSL handshake was successfully completed, a TLS/SSL connec-
           tion has been established.

       0   The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful but was shut down con-
           trolled and by the specifications of the TLS/SSL protocol. Call
           _S_S_L___g_e_t___e_r_r_o_r_(_) with the return value rreett to find out the reason.

       <0  The TLS/SSL handshake was not successful because a fatal error
           occurred either at the protocol level or a connection failure
           occurred. The shutdown was not clean. It can also occur of action
           is need to continue the operation for non-blocking BIOs. Call
           _S_S_L___g_e_t___e_r_r_o_r_(_) with the return value rreett to find out the reason.
