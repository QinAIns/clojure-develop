       tion.  It cannot be set for specific SSL_CTX or SSL objects.

       The TLS standard (or SSLv3) allows the integration of compression meth-
       ods into the communication. The TLS RFC does however not specify com-
       pression methods or their corresponding identifiers, so there is cur-
       rently no compatible way to integrate compression with unknown peers.
       It is therefore currently not recommended to integrate compression into
       applications. Applications for non-public use may agree on certain com-
       pression methods. Using different compression methods with the same
       identifier will lead to connection failure.

       An OpenSSL client speaking a protocol that allows compression (SSLv3,
       TLSv1) will unconditionally send the list of all compression methods
       enabled with _S_S_L___C_O_M_P___a_d_d___c_o_m_p_r_e_s_s_i_o_n___m_e_t_h_o_d_(_) to the server during the
       handshake.  Unlike the mechanisms to set a cipher list, there is no
       method available to restrict the list of compression method on a per
       connection basis.

       An OpenSSL server will match the identifiers listed by a client against
       its own compression methods and will unconditionally activate compres-
       sion when a matching identifier is found. There is no way to restrict
       the list of compression methods supported on a per connection basis.

       The OpenSSL library has the compression methods _CC_OO_MM_PP____rr_ll_ee_((_)) and (when
       especially enabled during compilation) _CC_OO_MM_PP____zz_ll_ii_bb_((_)) available.

       Once the identities of the compression methods for the TLS protocol
       have been standardized, the compression API will most likely be
       changed. Using it in the current state is not recommended.
