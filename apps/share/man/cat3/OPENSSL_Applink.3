       OPENSSL_Applink is application-side interface which provides a glue
       between OpenSSL BIO layer and Win32 compiler run-time environment.
       Even though it appears at application side, it's essentially OpenSSL
       private interface. For this reason application developers are not
       expected to implement it, but to compile provided module with compiler
       of their choice and link it into the target application.  The referred
       module is available as <openssl>/ms/applink.c.
