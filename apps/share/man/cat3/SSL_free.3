       _S_S_L___f_r_e_e_(_) decrements the reference count of ssssll, and removes the SSL
       structure pointed to by ssssll and frees up the allocated memory if the
       reference count has reached 0.

       _S_S_L___f_r_e_e_(_) also calls the _f_r_e_e_(_)ing procedures for indirectly affected
       items, if applicable: the buffering BIO, the read and write BIOs,
       cipher lists specially created for this ssssll, the SSSSLL__SSEESSSSIIOONN.  Do not
       explicitly free these indirectly freed up items before or after calling
       _S_S_L___f_r_e_e_(_), as trying to free things twice may lead to program failure.

       The ssl session has reference counts from two users: the SSL object,
       for which the reference count is removed by _S_S_L___f_r_e_e_(_) and the internal
       session cache. If the session is considered bad, because _S_S_L___s_h_u_t_-
       _d_o_w_n(3) was not called for the connection and _S_S_L___s_e_t___s_h_u_t_d_o_w_n(3) was
       not used to set the SSL_SENT_SHUTDOWN state, the session will also be
       removed from the session cache as required by RFC2246.
