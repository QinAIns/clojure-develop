       the peer presented. If the peer did not present a certificate, NULL is
       returned.

       Due to the protocol definition, a TLS/SSL server will always send a
       certificate, if present. A client will only send a certificate when
       explicitly requested to do so by the server (see _S_S_L___C_T_X___s_e_t___v_e_r_-
       _i_f_y(3)). If an anonymous cipher is used, no certificates are sent.

       That a certificate is returned does not indicate information about the
       verification state, use _S_S_L___g_e_t___v_e_r_i_f_y___r_e_s_u_l_t(3) to check the verifica-
       tion state.

       The reference count of the X509 object is incremented by one, so that
       it will not be destroyed when the session containing the peer certifi-
       cate is freed. The X509 object must be explicitly freed using
       _X_5_0_9___f_r_e_e_(_).

       The following return values can occur:

       NULL
           No certificate was presented by the peer or no connection was
           established.

       Pointer to an X509 certificate
           The return value points to the certificate presented by the peer.
