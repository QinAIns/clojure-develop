       SSL_SESSION objects are allocated, when a TLS/SSL handshake operation
       is successfully completed. Depending on the settings, see
       _S_S_L___C_T_X___s_e_t___s_e_s_s_i_o_n___c_a_c_h_e___m_o_d_e(3), the SSL_SESSION objects are inter-
       nally referenced by the SSL_CTX and linked into its session cache. SSL
       objects may be using the SSL_SESSION object; as a session may be
       reused, several SSL objects may be using one SSL_SESSION object at the
       same time. It is therefore crucial to keep the reference count (usage
       information) correct and not delete a SSL_SESSION object that is still
       used, as this may lead to program failures due to dangling pointers.
       These failures may also appear delayed, e.g.  when an SSL_SESSION
       object was completely freed as the reference count incorrectly became
       0, but it is still referenced in the internal session cache and the
       cache list is processed during a _S_S_L___C_T_X___f_l_u_s_h___s_e_s_s_i_o_n_s(3) operation.

       _S_S_L___S_E_S_S_I_O_N___f_r_e_e_(_) must only be called for SSL_SESSION objects, for
       which the reference count was explicitly incremented (e.g.  by calling
       _S_S_L___g_e_t_1___s_e_s_s_i_o_n_(_), see _S_S_L___g_e_t___s_e_s_s_i_o_n(3)) or when the SSL_SESSION
       object was generated outside a TLS handshake operation, e.g. by using
       _d_2_i___S_S_L___S_E_S_S_I_O_N(3).  It must not be called on other SSL_SESSION
       objects, as this would cause incorrect reference counts and therefore
       program failures.
