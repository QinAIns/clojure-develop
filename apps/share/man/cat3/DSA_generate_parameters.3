       _D_S_A___g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e___p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s_(_) generates primes p and q and a generator g
       for use in the DSA.

       bbiittss is the length of the prime to be generated; the DSS allows a maxi-
       mum of 1024 bits.

       If sseeeedd is NNUULLLL or sseeeedd__lleenn < 20, the primes will be generated at ran-
       dom. Otherwise, the seed is used to generate them. If the given seed
       does not yield a prime q, a new random seed is chosen and placed at
       sseeeedd.

       _D_S_A___g_e_n_e_r_a_t_e___p_a_r_a_m_e_t_e_r_s_(_) places the iteration count in *ccoouunntteerr__rreett
       and a counter used for finding a generator in *hh__rreett, unless these are
       NNUULLLL.

       A callback function may be used to provide feedback about the progress
       of the key generation. If ccaallllbbaacckk is not NNUULLLL, it will be called as
       follows:

       +o   When a candidate for q is generated, ccaallllbbaacckk((00,, mm++++,, ccbb__aarrgg)) is
           called (m is 0 for the first candidate).

       +o   When a candidate for q has passed a test by trial division, ccaallll--
           bbaacckk((11,, --11,, ccbb__aarrgg)) is called.  While a candidate for q is tested
           by Miller-Rabin primality tests, ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, ii,, ccbb__aarrgg)) is called
           in the outer loop (once for each witness that confirms that the
           candidate may be prime); i is the loop counter (starting at 0).

       +o   When a prime q has been found, ccaallllbbaacckk((22,, 00,, ccbb__aarrgg)) and ccaallll--
           bbaacckk((33,, 00,, ccbb__aarrgg)) are called.

       +o   Before a candidate for p (other than the first) is generated and
           tested, ccaallllbbaacckk((00,, ccoouunntteerr,, ccbb__aarrgg)) is called.

       +o   When a candidate for p has passed the test by trial division, ccaallll--
           bbaacckk((11,, --11,, ccbb__aarrgg)) is called.  While it is tested by the Miller-
           Rabin primality test, ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, ii,, ccbb__aarrgg)) is called in the outer
           loop (once for each witness that confirms that the candidate may be
           prime).  i is the loop counter (starting at 0).

       +o   When p has been found, ccaallllbbaacckk((22,, 11,, ccbb__aarrgg)) is called.

       +o   When the generator has been found, ccaallllbbaacckk((33,, 11,, ccbb__aarrgg)) is
           called.

       NNUULLLL if the parameter generation fails. The error codes can be obtained

       was added in SSLeay 0.9.0.  In versions up to OpenSSL 0.9.4, ccaallll--
       bbaacckk((11,, ......)) was called in the inner loop of the Miller-Rabin test
       whenever it reached the squaring step (the parameters to ccaallllbbaacckk did
       not reveal how many witnesses had been tested); since OpenSSL 0.9.5,
       ccaallllbbaacckk((11,, ......))  is called as in _B_N___i_s___p_r_i_m_e(3), i.e. once for each
       witness.  =cut
