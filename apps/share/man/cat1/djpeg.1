DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       ddjjppeegg  decompresses  the  named  JPEG file, or the standard input if no
       file is named, and produces an image file on the standard output.  PBM-
       PLUS  (PPM/PGM),  BMP,  GIF, Targa, or RLE (Utah Raster Toolkit) output
       format can be selected.  (RLE is supported only if the URT  library  is
       available.)

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       All  switch  names  may  be abbreviated; for example, --ggrraayyssccaallee may be
       written --ggrraayy or --ggrr.  Most of the "basic" switches can be  abbreviated
       to  as little as one letter.  Upper and lower case are equivalent (thus
       --BBMMPP is the same as --bbmmpp).  British spellings are also accepted  (e.g.,
       --ggrreeyyssccaallee), though for brevity these are not mentioned below.

       The basic switches are:

       --ccoolloorrss _N
              Reduce  image  to  at most N colors.  This reduces the number of
              colors used in the output image, so that it can be displayed  on
              a  colormapped  display  or stored in a colormapped file format.
              For example, if you have an 8-bit display, you'd need to  reduce
              to 256 or fewer colors.

       --qquuaannttiizzee _N
              Same  as --ccoolloorrss.  --ccoolloorrss is the recommended name, --qquuaannttiizzee is
              provided only for backwards compatibility.

       --ffaasstt  Select recommended processing options for fast, low quality out-
              put.   (The  default options are chosen for highest quality out-
              put.)  Currently, this is  equivalent  to  --ddcctt  ffaasstt  --nnoossmmooootthh
              --oonneeppaassss --ddiitthheerr oorrddeerreedd.

       --ggrraayyssccaallee
              Force  gray-scale output even if JPEG file is color.  Useful for
              viewing on monochrome  displays;  also,  ddjjppeegg  runs  noticeably
              faster in this mode.

       --ssccaallee _M_/_N
              Scale  the  output  image  by a factor M/N.  Currently supported
              scale factors are M/N with all M from 1 to 16, where  N  is  the
              source  DCT  size, which is 8 for baseline JPEG.  If the /N part
              is omitted, then M specifies the DCT scaled size to  be  applied
              on the given input.  For baseline JPEG this is equivalent to M/8
              scaling, since the source DCT  size  for  baseline  JPEG  is  8.
              Scaling  is handy if the image is larger than your screen; also,
              ddjjppeegg runs much faster when scaling down the output.

       --bbmmpp   Select BMP output format (Windows  flavor).   8-bit  colormapped
              format  is  emitted if --ccoolloorrss or --ggrraayyssccaallee is specified, or if
              the JPEG file is gray-scale; otherwise, 24-bit full-color format
              is emitted.

       --ggiiff   Select  GIF output format.  Since GIF does not support more than
              256 colors, --ccoolloorrss 225566 is assumed (unless you specify a smaller
              number of colors).

       --ooss22   Select  BMP  output format (OS/2 1.x flavor).  8-bit colormapped
              format is emitted if --ccoolloorrss or --ggrraayyssccaallee is specified,  or  if
              the JPEG file is gray-scale; otherwise, 24-bit full-color format
              is emitted.

       --ppnnmm   Select PBMPLUS (PPM/PGM) output format (this is the default for-
              mat).   PGM  is  emitted  if  the  JPEG file is gray-scale or if
              --ggrraayyssccaallee is specified; otherwise PPM is emitted.

       --rrllee   Select RLE output format.  (Requires URT library.)

       --ttaarrggaa Select Targa output format.  Gray-scale format is emitted if the
              JPEG  file  is  gray-scale or if --ggrraayyssccaallee is specified; other-
              wise, colormapped format is emitted  if  --ccoolloorrss  is  specified;
              otherwise, 24-bit full-color format is emitted.

       Switches for advanced users:

       --ddcctt iinntt
              Use integer DCT method (default).

       --ddcctt ffaasstt
              Use fast integer DCT (less accurate).

       --ddcctt ffllooaatt
              Use  floating-point  DCT  method.   The  float  method  is  very
              slightly more accurate than the int method, but is  much  slower
              unless your machine has very fast floating-point hardware.  Also
              note that results of the floating-point method may vary slightly
              across  machines, while the integer methods should give the same
              results everywhere.  The fast integer method is much less  accu-
              rate than the other two.

       --ddiitthheerr ffss
              Use Floyd-Steinberg dithering in color quantization.

       --ddiitthheerr oorrddeerreedd
              Use ordered dithering in color quantization.

       --ddiitthheerr nnoonnee
              Do  not use dithering in color quantization.  By default, Floyd-
              Steinberg dithering is applied when quantizing colors;  this  is
              slow but usually produces the best results.  Ordered dither is a
              compromise between speed and quality; no dithering is  fast  but
              usually  looks  awful.   Note that these switches have no effect
              unless color quantization is being done.  Ordered dither is only
              available in --oonneeppaassss mode.

       --mmaapp _f_i_l_e
              Quantize  to  the colors used in the specified image file.  This
              is useful for producing  multiple  files  with  identical  color
              maps, or for forcing a predefined set of colors to be used.  The
              _f_i_l_e must be a GIF or PPM file. This  option  overrides  --ccoolloorrss
              and --oonneeppaassss.

       --nnoossmmooootthh
              Don't use high-quality upsampling.

       --oonneeppaassss
              Use  one-pass  instead of two-pass color quantization.  The one-
              pass method is faster and needs less memory, but it  produces  a
              lower-quality  image.   --oonneeppaassss  is ignored unless you also say
              --ccoolloorrss _N.  Also, the one-pass method is always used  for  gray-
              scale output (the two-pass method is no improvement then).

       --mmaaxxmmeemmoorryy _N
              Set  limit  for  amount  of  memory  to  use in processing large
              images.  Value is in thousands of bytes, or millions of bytes if
              "M"  is  attached  to  the number.  For example, --mmaaxx 44mm selects
              4000000 bytes.  If more space is needed, temporary files will be
              used.

       --oouuttffiillee _n_a_m_e
              Send output image to the named file, not to standard output.

       --vveerrbboossee
              Enable  debug printout.  More --vv's give more output.  Also, ver-
              sion information is printed at startup.

       --ddeebbuugg Same as --vveerrbboossee.

EEXXAAMMPPLLEESS
       This example decompresses the JPEG file foo.jpg, quantizes  it  to  256
       colors, and saves the output in 8-bit BMP format in foo.bmp:

              ddjjppeegg --ccoolloorrss 225566 --bbmmpp _f_o_o_._j_p_g >> _f_o_o_._b_m_p

HHIINNTTSS
       To  get  a  quick preview of an image, use the --ggrraayyssccaallee and/or --ssccaallee
       switches.  --ggrraayyssccaallee --ssccaallee 11//88 is the fastest case.

       Several options are available that trade  off  image  quality  to  gain
       speed.  --ffaasstt turns on the recommended settings.

       --ddcctt  ffaasstt and/or --nnoossmmooootthh gain speed at a small sacrifice in quality.
       When producing a color-quantized image,  --oonneeppaassss  --ddiitthheerr  oorrddeerreedd  is
       fast  but  much  lower quality than the default behavior.  --ddiitthheerr nnoonnee
       may give acceptable results in two-pass mode, but is  seldom  tolerable
       in one-pass mode.

       If  you are fortunate enough to have very fast floating point hardware,
       --ddcctt ffllooaatt may be even faster than --ddcctt ffaasstt.   But  on  most  machines
       --ddcctt ffllooaatt is slower than --ddcctt iinntt; in this case it is not worth using,
       because its theoretical accuracy advantage is too small to be  signifi-
       cant in practice.

EENNVVIIRROONNMMEENNTT
       JJPPEEGGMMEEMM
              If  this  environment  variable is set, its value is the default
              memory limit.  The value  is  specified  as  described  for  the
              --mmaaxxmmeemmoorryy  switch.   JJPPEEGGMMEEMM overrides the default value speci-
              fied when the program was compiled, and itself is overridden  by
              an explicit --mmaaxxmmeemmoorryy.
