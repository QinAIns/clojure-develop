DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The ttss command is a basic Time Stamping Authority (TSA) client and
       server application as specified in RFC 3161 (Time-Stamp Protocol, TSP).
       A TSA can be part of a PKI deployment and its role is to provide long
       term proof of the existence of a certain datum before a particular
       time. Here is a brief description of the protocol:

       1.  The TSA client computes a one-way hash value for a data file and
           sends the hash to the TSA.

       2.  The TSA attaches the current date and time to the received hash
           value, signs them and sends the time stamp token back to the
           client. By creating this token the TSA certifies the existence of
           the original data file at the time of response generation.

       3.  The TSA client receives the time stamp token and verifies the sig-
           nature on it. It also checks if the token contains the same hash
           value that it had sent to the TSA.

       There is one DER encoded protocol data unit defined for transporting a
       time stamp request to the TSA and one for sending the time stamp
       response back to the client. The ttss command has three main functions:
       creating a time stamp request based on a data file, creating a time
       stamp response based on a request, verifying if a response corresponds
       to a particular request or a data file.

       There is no support for sending the requests/responses automatically
       over HTTP or TCP yet as suggested in RFC 3161. The users must send the
       requests either by ftp or e-mail.

       The --qquueerryy switch can be used for creating and printing a time stamp
       request with the following options:

       --rraanndd file:file...
           The files containing random data for seeding the random number gen-
           erator. Multiple files can be specified, the separator is ;; for
           MS-Windows, ,, for VMS and :: for all other platforms. (Optional)

       --ccoonnffiigg configfile
           The configuration file to use, this option overrides the
           OOPPEENNSSSSLL__CCOONNFF environment variable. Only the OID section of the con-
           fig file is used with the --qquueerryy command. (Optional)

       --ddaattaa file_to_hash
           The data file for which the time stamp request needs to be created.
           stdin is the default if neither the --ddaattaa nor the --ddiiggeesstt parameter
           is specified. (Optional)

       --ddiiggeesstt digest_bytes
           It is possible to specify the message imprint explicitly without
           the data file. The imprint must be specified in a hexadecimal for-
           mat, two characters per byte, the bytes optionally separated by
           colons (e.g. 1A:F6:01:... or 1AF601...). The number of bytes must
           match the message digest algorithm in use. (Optional)

       --mmdd22|--mmdd44|--mmdd55|--sshhaa|--sshhaa11|--mmddcc22|--rriippeemmdd116600|......
           The message digest to apply to the data file, it supports all the
           message digest algorithms that are supported by the openssl ddggsstt
           command.  The default is SHA-1. (Optional)

       --ppoolliiccyy object_id
           The policy that the client expects the TSA to use for creating the
           time stamp token. Either the dotted OID notation or OID names
           defined in the config file can be used. If no policy is requested
           the TSA will use its own default policy. (Optional)

       --nnoo__nnoonnccee
           No nonce is specified in the request if this option is given. Oth-
           erwise a 64 bit long pseudo-random none is included in the request.
           It is recommended to use nonce to protect against replay-attacks.
           (Optional)

       --cceerrtt
           The TSA is expected to include its signing certificate in the
           response. (Optional)

       --iinn request.tsq
           This option specifies a previously created time stamp request in
           DER format that will be printed into the output file. Useful when
           you need to examine the content of a request in human-readable

           format. (Optional)

       --oouutt request.tsq
           Name of the output file to which the request will be written.
           Default is stdout. (Optional)

       --tteexxtt
           If this option is specified the output is human-readable text for-
           mat instead of DER. (Optional)

       TTiimmee SSttaammpp RReessppoonnssee ggeenneerraattiioonn

       A time stamp response (TimeStampResp) consists of a response status and
       the time stamp token itself (ContentInfo), if the token generation was
       successful. The --rreeppllyy command is for creating a time stamp response or
       time stamp token based on a request and printing the response/token in
       human-readable format. If --ttookkeenn__oouutt is not specified the output is
       always a time stamp response (TimeStampResp), otherwise it is a time
       stamp token (ContentInfo).

       --ccoonnffiigg configfile
           The configuration file to use, this option overrides the
           OOPPEENNSSSSLL__CCOONNFF environment variable. See CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN FFIILLEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
           for configurable variables. (Optional)

       --sseeccttiioonn tsa_section
           The name of the config file section conatining the settings for the
           response generation. If not specified the default TSA section is
           used, see CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN FFIILLEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS for details. (Optional)

       --qquueerryyffiillee request.tsq
           The name of the file containing a DER encoded time stamp request.
           (Optional)

       --ppaassssiinn password_src
           Specifies the password source for the private key of the TSA. See
           PPAASSSS PPHHRRAASSEE AARRGGUUMMEENNTTSS in _o_p_e_n_s_s_l(1). (Optional)

       --ssiiggnneerr tsa_cert.pem
           The signer certificate of the TSA in PEM format. The TSA signing
           certificate must have exactly one extended key usage assigned to
           it: timeStamping. The extended key usage must also be critical,
           otherwise the certificate is going to be refused. Overrides the
           ssiiggnneerr__cceerrtt variable of the config file. (Optional)

       --iinnkkeeyy private.pem
           The signer private key of the TSA in PEM format. Overrides the
           ssiiggnneerr__kkeeyy config file option. (Optional)

       --cchhaaiinn certs_file.pem
           The collection of certificates in PEM format that will all be
           included in the response in addition to the signer certificate if
           the --cceerrtt option was used for the request. This file is supposed to
           contain the certificate chain for the signer certificate from its
           issuer upwards. The --rreeppllyy command does not build a certificate
           chain automatically. (Optional)

       --ppoolliiccyy object_id
           The default policy to use for the response unless the client
           explicitly requires a particular TSA policy. The OID can be speci-
           fied either in dotted notation or with its name. Overrides the
           ddeeffaauulltt__ppoolliiccyy config file option. (Optional)

       --iinn response.tsr
           Specifies a previously created time stamp response or time stamp
           token (if --ttookkeenn__iinn is also specified) in DER format that will be
           written to the output file. This option does not require a request,
           it is useful e.g. when you need to examine the content of a
           response or token or you want to extract the time stamp token from
           a response. If the input is a token and the output is a time stamp
           response a default 'granted' status info is added to the token.
           (Optional)

       --ttookkeenn__iinn
           This flag can be used together with the --iinn option and indicates
           that the input is a DER encoded time stamp token (ContentInfo)
           instead of a time stamp response (TimeStampResp). (Optional)

       --oouutt response.tsr
           The response is written to this file. The format and content of the
           file depends on other options (see --tteexxtt, --ttookkeenn__oouutt). The default
           is stdout. (Optional)

       --ttookkeenn__oouutt
           The output is a time stamp token (ContentInfo) instead of time
           stamp response (TimeStampResp). (Optional)

       --tteexxtt
           If this option is specified the output is human-readable text for-
           mat instead of DER. (Optional)

       --eennggiinnee id
           Specifying an engine (by its unique iidd string) will cause ttss to
           attempt to obtain a functional reference to the specified engine,
           thus initialising it if needed. The engine will then be set as the
           default for all available algorithms. Default is builtin.
           (Optional)

       TTiimmee SSttaammpp RReessppoonnssee vveerriiffiiccaattiioonn

       The --vveerriiffyy command is for verifying if a time stamp response or time
       stamp token is valid and matches a particular time stamp request or
       data file. The --vveerriiffyy command does not use the configuration file.

       --ddaattaa file_to_hash
           The response or token must be verified against file_to_hash. The
           file is hashed with the message digest algorithm specified in the
           token.  The --ddiiggeesstt and --qquueerryyffiillee options must not be specified
           with this one.  (Optional)

       --ddiiggeesstt digest_bytes
           The response or token must be verified against the message digest
           specified with this option. The number of bytes must match the mes-
           sage digest algorithm specified in the token. The --ddaattaa and --qquueerryy--
           ffiillee options must not be specified with this one. (Optional)

       --qquueerryyffiillee request.tsq
           The original time stamp request in DER format. The --ddaattaa and
           --ddiiggeesstt options must not be specified with this one. (Optional)

       --iinn response.tsr
           The time stamp response that needs to be verified in DER format.
           (Mandatory)

       --ttookkeenn__iinn
           This flag can be used together with the --iinn option and indicates
           that the input is a DER encoded time stamp token (ContentInfo)
           instead of a time stamp response (TimeStampResp). (Optional)

       --CCAAppaatthh trusted_cert_path
           The name of the directory containing the trused CA certificates of
           the client. See the similar option of _v_e_r_i_f_y(1) for additional
           details. Either this option or --CCAAffiillee must be specified.
           (Optional)

       --CCAAffiillee trusted_certs.pem
           The name of the file containing a set of trusted self-signed CA
           certificates in PEM format. See the similar option of _v_e_r_i_f_y(1) for
           additional details. Either this option or --CCAAppaatthh must be speci-
           fied.  (Optional)

       --uunnttrruusstteedd cert_file.pem
           Set of additional untrusted certificates in PEM format which may be
           needed when building the certificate chain for the TSA's signing
           certificate. This file must contain the TSA signing certificate and
           all intermediate CA certificates unless the response includes them.
           (Optional)

CCOONNFFIIGGUURRAATTIIOONN FFIILLEE OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       The --qquueerryy and --rreeppllyy commands make use of a configuration file defined
       by the OOPPEENNSSSSLL__CCOONNFF environment variable. See _c_o_n_f_i_g(5) for a general
       description of the syntax of the config file. The --qquueerryy command uses
       only the symbolic OID names section and it can work without it. How-
       ever, the --rreeppllyy command needs the config file for its operation.

       When there is a command line switch equivalent of a variable the switch
       always overrides the settings in the config file.

       ttssaa section, ddeeffaauulltt__ttssaa
           This is the main section and it specifies the name of another sec-
           tion that contains all the options for the --rreeppllyy command. This
           default section can be overriden with the --sseeccttiioonn command line
           switch. (Optional)

       ooiidd__ffiillee

       sseerriiaall
           The name of the file containing the hexadecimal serial number of
           the last time stamp response created. This number is incremented by
           1 for each response. If the file does not exist at the time of
           response generation a new file is created with serial number 1.
           (Mandatory)

       ccrryyppttoo__ddeevviiccee
           Specifies the OpenSSL engine that will be set as the default for
           all available algorithms. The default value is builtin, you can
           specify any other engines supported by OpenSSL (e.g. use chil for
           the NCipher HSM).  (Optional)

       ssiiggnneerr__cceerrtt
           TSA signing certificate in PEM format. The same as the --ssiiggnneerr com-

       cceerrttss
           A file containing a set of PEM encoded certificates that need to be
           included in the response. The same as the --cchhaaiinn command line
           option. (Optional)

       ssiiggnneerr__kkeeyy
           The private key of the TSA in PEM format. The same as the --iinnkkeeyy

           The default policy to use when the request does not mandate any
           policy. The same as the --ppoolliiccyy command line option. (Optional)

       ootthheerr__ppoolliicciieess
           Comma separated list of policies that are also acceptable by the
           TSA and used only if the request explicitly specifies one of them.
           (Optional)

       ddiiggeessttss
           The list of message digest algorithms that the TSA accepts. At
           least one algorithm must be specified. (Mandatory)

           The accuracy of the time source of the TSA in seconds, milliseconds
           and microseconds. E.g. secs:1, millisecs:500, microsecs:100. If any
           of the components is missing zero is assumed for that field.
           (Optional)

       cclloocckk__pprreecciissiioonn__ddiiggiittss
           Specifies the maximum number of digits, which represent the frac-
           tion of seconds, that  need to be included in the time field. The
           trailing zeroes must be removed from the time, so there might actu-
           ally be fewer digits, or no fraction of seconds at all. Supported
           only on UNIX platforms.  The maximum value is 6, default is 0.
           (Optional)

           If this option is yes the responses generated by this TSA can
           always be ordered, even if the time difference between two
           responses is less than the sum of their accuracies. Default is no.

           Set this option to yes if the subject name of the TSA must be
           included in the TSA name field of the response. Default is no.

           The SignedData objects created by the TSA always contain the cer-
           tificate identifier of the signing certificate in a signed
           attribute (see RFC 2634, Enhanced Security Services). If this
           option is set to yes and either the cceerrttss variable or the --cchhaaiinn
           option is specified then the certificate identifiers of the chain
           will also be included in the SigningCertificate signed attribute.
           If this variable is set to no, only the signing certificate identi-
           fier is included. Default is no. (Optional)

       To create a time stamp request for design1.txt with SHA-1 without nonce
       and policy and no certificate is required in the response:

         openssl ts -query -data design1.txt -no_nonce \
               -out design1.tsq

       To create a similar time stamp request with specifying the message
       imprint explicitly:

         openssl ts -query -digest b7e5d3f93198b38379852f2c04e78d73abdd0f4b \
                -no_nonce -out design1.tsq

       To print the content of the previous request in human readable format:

         openssl ts -query -in design1.tsq -text

       To create a time stamp request which includes the MD-5 digest of
       design2.txt, requests the signer certificate and nonce, specifies a
       policy id (assuming the tsa_policy1 name is defined in the OID section
       of the config file):

         openssl ts -query -data design2.txt -md5 \
               -policy tsa_policy1 -cert -out design2.tsq

       Before generating a response a signing certificate must be created for
       the TSA that contains the ttiimmeeSSttaammppiinngg critical extended key usage
       extension without any other key usage extensions. You can add the
       'extendedKeyUsage = critical,timeStamping' line to the user certificate
       section of the config file to generate a proper certificate. See
       _r_e_q(1), _c_a(1), _x_5_0_9(1) for instructions. The examples below assume that
       cacert.pem contains the certificate of the CA, tsacert.pem is the sign-
       ing certificate issued by cacert.pem and tsakey.pem is the private key
       of the TSA.

       To create a time stamp response for a request:

         openssl ts -reply -queryfile design1.tsq -inkey tsakey.pem \
               -signer tsacert.pem -out design1.tsr

       If you want to use the settings in the config file you could just
       write:

         openssl ts -reply -queryfile design1.tsq -out design1.tsr

       To print a time stamp reply to stdout in human readable format:

         openssl ts -reply -in design1.tsr -text

       To create a time stamp token instead of time stamp response:

         openssl ts -reply -queryfile design1.tsq -out design1_token.der -token_out

       To print a time stamp token to stdout in human readable format:

         openssl ts -reply -in design1_token.der -token_in -text -token_out

       To extract the time stamp token from a response:

         openssl ts -reply -in design1.tsr -out design1_token.der -token_out

       To add 'granted' status info to a time stamp token thereby creating a
       valid response:

         openssl ts -reply -in design1_token.der -token_in -out design1.tsr

       TTiimmee SSttaammpp VVeerriiffiiccaattiioonn

       To verify a time stamp reply against a request:

         openssl ts -verify -queryfile design1.tsq -in design1.tsr \
               -CAfile cacert.pem -untrusted tsacert.pem

       To verify a time stamp reply that includes the certificate chain:

         openssl ts -verify -queryfile design2.tsq -in design2.tsr \
               -CAfile cacert.pem

       To verify a time stamp token against the original data file:
         openssl ts -verify -data design2.txt -in design2.tsr \      -CAfile
       cacert.pem

       To verify a time stamp token against a message imprint:
         openssl ts -verify -digest b7e5d3f93198b38379852f2c04e78d73abdd0f4b \
             -in design2.tsr -CAfile cacert.pem

       You could also look at the 'test' directory for more examples.

       If you find any bugs or you have suggestions please write to Zoltan
       Glozik <zglozik@opentsa.org>. Known issues:

       * No support for time stamps over SMTP, though it is quite easy to
       implement an automatic e-mail based TSA with _p_r_o_c_m_a_i_l(1) and _p_e_r_l(1).
       HTTP server support is provided in the form of a separate apache mod-
       ule. HTTP client support is provided by _t_s_g_e_t(1). Pure TCP/IP protocol
       is not supported.
       * The file containing the last serial number of the TSA is not locked
       when being read or written. This is a problem if more than one instance
       of _o_p_e_n_s_s_l(1) is trying to create a time stamp response at the same
       time. This is not an issue when using the apache server module, it does
       proper locking.
       * Look for the FIXME word in the source files.
       * The source code should really be reviewed by somebody else, too.
       * More testing is needed, I have done only some basic tests (see
       test/testtsa).
